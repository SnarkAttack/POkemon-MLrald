Reinforcement Learning for Pokemon Emerald

Inspired by Peter Whidden's [Training AI to Play Pokemon with Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&t=26s)

Pokemon Emerald is still my favorite Pokemon Game ever created, and I thought it would be fun to try and create an RL agent to play it and see what we learn to do!
